# SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is a perceptual metric that quantifies image quality degradation* caused by processing such as data compression or by losses in data transmission. It is a full reference metric that requires two images from the same image captureâ€” a reference image and a processed image.
